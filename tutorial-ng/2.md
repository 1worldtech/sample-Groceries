## Lesson 2. Creating User Interfaces

In this lesson, you’re going to learn how to build NativeScript user interfaces, including markup, styling, images, and more.

To do that, the rest of this guide will walk you through building [Groceries](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries), a groceries management app that does the following things:

- Connects to an existing RESTful service.
- Provides user registration and login.
- Lets authenticated users add and delete groceries from a list.
- Runs cross-platform (iOS and Android).

If you follow this tutorial to the end you’ll have an app that looks like this.

> **TODO:** Add images for iOS and Android.

Let’s get started building by looking at how to add user interface components.

### Step 1. Adding UI components

The primary difference between building an app for the web and an app with NativeScript is in the UI elements that you use. NativeScript apps do not use a browser and do not have a DOM; therefore, elements like `<div>` and `<span>` simply do not work.

No worries though, as NativeScript provides an [extensive suite of UI elements](http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/ui-views), each of which are implemented with native iOS and Android controls. For instance, the [`<Label>` control](http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/ui-views#label) our previous example used is actually rendered as a [`UILabel`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UILabel_Class/) on iOS and an [`android.widget.TextView`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html) on Android. The great thing about using NativeScript though, is that these native details are transparent to use as a developer. You type `<Label>` and let NativeScript handle the rendering details.

Let’s put this into action by adding some new UI components to start building the Groceries UI.

<hr data-action="start" />

#### Action

* **a.** Open your `app/app.component.ts` file and replace its contents with the following code.

``` TypeScript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: `
    <StackLayout>
      <TextField hint="Email Address" keyboardType="email"
        autocorrect="false" autocapitalizationType="none"></TextField>
      <TextField hint="Password" secure="true"></TextField>

      <Button text="Sign in"></Button>
      <Button text="Sign up for Groceries"></Button>
    </StackLayout>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

* **b.** Save your `app/app.component.ts` file. You should see the following user interface on your device.

> **TODO**: Insert iOS and Android images

<hr data-action="end" />

There is a whole lot going on in this example, especially if you’re new to Angular. Throughout this tutorial you’ll see expandable **Background** sections that you can open for more information on the features you’re using. Here are a few things you might want to review before focusing on the UI components.

#### Background: What does the `import` keyword do?

The `import` keyword is a newer feature of JavaScript that allows you to import functions, variables, and classes from one JavaScript module into another.

In this case you’re using the `import` command to get a reference the Angular `Component` class from the `@angular/core` npm module.

#### Background: What is `@Component`?

In Angular. a component manages a view, or a piece of the user interface that the user sees. A component can be used to define an individual UI element, or an entire page, and eventually you’ll add a bunch of logic to these components and use them to build an entire app.

Notice the interesting way that the `Component` class is used—with the syntax `@Component`. This is a [TypeScript decorator](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Decorators.md), which allows you to annotate a TypeScript class or method with additional information. For now, you can think of it as a way of adding some metadata configuration to the currently empty `AppComponent` class. Specifically, the `@Component` decorator’s `template` property tells NativeScript how to render this component on the screen.
